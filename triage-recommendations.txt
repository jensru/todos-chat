âœ… Mistral Response:
Based on the information you've provided, here are my recommendations:

1. Todos to be done today:
- Define work blocks for today
- Tackle the Schimmel-Problem (it's marked as important)
- If not already done, say hello to everyone with a lead funnel strategy
- If time allows, start organizing your workspace (BÃ¼ro aufrÃ¤umen)

2. Todos that can be moved to tomorrow/Friday:
- Pricing-Strategie entwickeln (since it was already moved once)

3. Patterns in the Triage-History:
- There seems to be a pattern of moving items to Friday. This might indicate that Fridays are often used as a "catch-up" day for tasks that couldn't be completed during the week.

4. Priorities:
- Based on the current list, the most pressing matters seem to be dealing with the Schimmel-Problem and preparing for the day by defining work blocks.
- For the future, it might be beneficial to allocate specific days for certain tasks. For example, setting aside Fridays for tasks that couldn't be completed during the week.
- Also, it would be helpful to break down larger tasks, like "Pricing-Strategie entwickeln", into smaller, manageable tasks that can be completed in a day or two. This can help prevent the task from being moved multiple times and ensure steady progress.

I hope this helps! If you have any other questions or need further clarification, feel free to ask.
